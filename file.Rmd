```{r GetBitcoinData, warnings = FALSE}

Use('Quandl')

Btc_tx <- suppressWarnings( Quandl("BCHAIN/NTRAN") )


d2 <- t(Btc_tx)
b_tx <- as.numeric( d2[,2] )

# Format seems to be completely broken...
# ... fixing it.
Dates <- seq(from = as.Date("2016-04-12"), to = as.Date("2009-01-03"), by = "-1 day")
length(Dates) == length(b_tx) # TRUe

# Reassemble the data, formatted correctly
BTC_tx <- data.frame(  "date"=Dates,
                       "b.tx"=b_tx    )[-1,]

head(BTC_tx)
lapply(BTC_tx, class) # Date, numeric

```


```{r, FootballData}

Use("XLConnect")

Excel_Sheet <- "https://excelfantasyfootball.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/nfl-2015-schedule-free-excel-spreadsheet/"
# Modified by me.

Data2 <- readNamedRegionFromFile(file = "C:/Users/Psztorc/Documents/GitHub/btc-sportsbet-research/nfl-2015-schedule-pfs.xlsx", "paul")

SportsDates <- data.frame("date" = as.Date(Data2[,1]),
                          "gametype" = factor(Data2[,2]))

lapply(SportsDates, class) # Date, numeric

SportsDates$daybefore <- SportsDates$date - 1

```

Merge and Plot
------------------

Time to combine the two datasets, and compare them. 

I compare using a basic visualization, and a basic linear model.


```{r, Merge and Plot}

# BTC Transactions Near the 2015 Season
Set1 <- BTC_tx[50:300,]
Set2 <- SportsDates[,-1]
names(Set2)[2] <- "date"
All <- merge( Set1, Set2 , all = TRUE)

# Add a new factor, for days where there isn't a game tomorrow.
temp <- as.character(All[,3])
temp[ is.na(temp) ] <-  "None"
All[,3] <- as.factor(temp)

All$GameTomorrow <- All[,3] != "None"

Use('ggplot2')

p1 <- ggplot(All, aes(x=b.tx, color=GameTomorrow))
p1 + geom_density(size=2) + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Today's # of BTC txns", y = "Density", title = "June 17, 2015 through Feb 22, 2016") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

m1 <- lm(b.tx ~ date + GameTomorrow, data = All)
summary(m1)

```

The dates were chosen arbitrarily by me. I did not revise them (not once!), and therefore did no data dredging (you'll have to take my word for it)!

The results would appear to be that "having a football game tomorrow" is associated with about 8000 *fewer* Bitcoin transactions.

I have no idea who used what time zone, to calculate either of the two datasets that I merged! So this research is basically worthless although it was fun to do while I finished listening to the weekly Bitcoin Uncensored.
